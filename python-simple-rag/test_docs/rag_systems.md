# RAG Systems and Vector Search

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines retrieval of relevant information with text generation. This approach is particularly useful for building question-answering systems and chatbots.

## How RAG Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: Documents are processed and split into chunks
2. **Vectorization**: Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding
3. **Storage**: Vectors and text are stored in a database
4. **Retrieval**: Given a query, similar chunks are found using vector search
5. **Generation**: Retrieved context is used to generate comprehensive answers

## Vector Search in RushDB

RushDB provides native vector search capabilities that make implementing RAG systems straightforward:

- **Cosine Similarity**: Built-in cosine similarity function for vector comparison
- **Threshold Filtering**: Set minimum similarity thresholds for results
- **Efficient Indexing**: Optimized vector indexing for fast searches
- **Multiple Metrics**: Support for different distance metrics

Vector search enables semantic similarity matching, going beyond simple keyword matching to understand the meaning and context of queries.

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate chunk sizes (typically 200-1000 words)
- Choose embedding models suitable for your domain
- Set reasonable similarity thresholds
- Consider document metadata for filtering
- Implement duplicate detection for efficiency
